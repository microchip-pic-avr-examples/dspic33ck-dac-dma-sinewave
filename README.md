## Sine Wave Demo

![Overall Project](images/Explorer16_32_connection.png)

# Summary

This demo demonstrates how to generate a 100 Hz sine wave without CPU intervention using the DMA and DAC peripherals of the dsPIC33CK device. This demo is interchangable between the Explorer Board 16/32 with dsPIC33CK256MP508 PIM and the dsPIC33CK Curiosity development boards (with varying output pins). 

The DMA peripheral will utilize the Capture/Compare event generated by the SCCP module to iterate and place values from a 256 point sine lookup table to a DAC peripheral for output.

## Software Setup

### Programming the Device
1. Open the dspic33ck_dac_dma_sinewave.X project in MPLAB® X IDE.
2. Right click the project in "Projects" tab of MPLAB® X IDE and select "Set as Main Project".
3. Plug in the PKOB (PICkit On-Board) or the PICKit 4 from the board to the PC.
4. Program the device by selecting the "Make and Program Device (Project dspic33ck_dac_dma_sinewave)" button on the menu bar.
5. The project should build and program successfully.

### Peripheral Configurations
Omitted configurations are default values set by MCC Melody. 

#### 1. DMA Melody Driver's DMA Channel 0 Settings:

|Setting|Value|Explaination|
|---|----|---|
|Enable Channel|False| Starts with channel disabled since it needs to be enabled after SCCP1 in PWM mode is initailized in the main.c.|
|Enable Reload|True|The registers are reloaded to previous values at the next start.|
|Transfer Mode|Repeated One-Shot|This allows the DMA to iterate and transfer data one value per event until it reaches the transfer count.|
|Trigger Sources|SCCP1 Timer/OC/IC Event|This checks for an of the SCCP1 capture/compare event. (Triggered by running SCCP1 in PWM mode) |
|Source Address Mode|Incremented|Increments the Source Address value by the Data Size|
|Source Address|0|This is set within the applicaiton code to use the address of the first sine wave point.|
|Destination Address Mode|Unchanged|This means the destination address will not be affected by the DMA iteration.|
|Destination Address|0|This is set within the applicaiton code.|
|Data Size|16 bit|Sets that transaction size.|
|Transfer Count|0x100|The number of times to iterate in one-shot. (256 points)|

|Requested Frequency (Hz)|25600|This value is calculated based on the number of points to iterate multiplied by the expected output frequecy. *Continued explaination in the explaination section below.|
|Sync/Trigger|Sync|This is set since PWM is not triggered by any external interrupt.|
|Interrupt Driven|Disabled|This is disabled so the ISR does not impact the DMA functionality.|
|PWM PLIB Selector|SCCP1|This generates a capture/compare event being used by the DMA driver.|

## PWM Melody driver's requested frequency explaination

The PWM Melody driver (not hardware peripheral) had to be used due to the DMA expecting the SCCP Capture/Compare event to occur. The DMA Melody driver may say "SCCP1 Timer/OC/IC Event" in some versions of the DMA driver but this is incorrect. The dsPIC33CK256MP508's DMA peripheral will only look for the SCCP1 Capture/Compare Events if this option is selected. 

The SCCP1 capture/compare event (being used as the DMA trigger to update the DAC value) occurs on every falling edge of the PWM. The frequency we select in the PWM driver in Hz represents the number of SCCP1 events per second. Since the sine lookup table is defined, the SCCP1 event needs to occur 256 times per 1 Hz of the expected output to represent the Correct period. This boils down to a multiplication problem:

PWM Frequency (Hz) = Points Length (Sine wave table Length) * Required Output Frequency (Hz)

For example, if there is a need to lower the frequency of the sine wave output to 10 Hz with a 256 point sine wave lookup table updating the PWM to use a frequency of 2560 Hz should represent that output.

**There is however a hardware limit for the PWM requested frequency and the SCCP's interaction with the DMA driver**

When configuring the requested frequency for the PWM there is the calculated frequency listed in Melody. This is done by using the formulas defined by the dsPIC33CK256MP508's datasheet to calculate the period register's values:

![Period Register](images/CCPXPRL.png)


For Higher requested frequencies the accuracy of the period is lower. The output compare buffer register is also affected by this due to its formulas:

![Output Compare Data Buffer](images/CCPXRB.png)

In testing here are the following values for the Min and Max frequencies for PWM to trigger output compare events for sine wave outputs:

|Requested PWM Frequency|Sine wave output frequency|
|---------------------|----------------------|
|25.6 Hz (Near Minimum requested Frequency)| 0.1 Hz|
|256 Hz|1 Hz|
|2560 Hz|10 Hz|
|25600 Hz| 100 Hz|
|256000 Hz| 1 kHz|
|2560000 Hz| 9.8 kHz|
|25600000 Hz|78 kHz|
|100000000 Hz (Maximum Requested Frequency)|97 kHz|
